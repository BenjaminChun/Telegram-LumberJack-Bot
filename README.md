# Telegram-LumberJack-Bot
You know the game on Telegram? Yeah that one with a guy cutting a tree down and getting hit by branches. I'm working on a program that can beat any highscore out there with the use of mainly pyautogui library.
This program is made to run on a 1920 x 1080 display with a right splitscreen window with 100% zoom settings for LumberJack.
Download main.py and get your new highscore!
